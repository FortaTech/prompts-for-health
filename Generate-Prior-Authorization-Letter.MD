Re: Prior Authorization Request for John Doe (DOB: 02/15/1980)
Policy Number: GH73849302
Group Number: GH30012001

Dear Prior Authorization Reviewer,

I am writing to seek authorization for a Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS) for my patient, Mr. John Doe. The specifics of his current medical situation and the necessity of this device for his health and well-being are outlined below.

Patient Profile:

Name: John Doe
Date of Birth: 02/15/1980
Address: 1234 Elm Street, Anytown, State, 12345
Phone Number: (555) 123-4567
Primary Care Physician: Dr. Amy Smith, MD
Medical History:

Diagnoses:
Hypertension (ICD-10: I10)
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (ICD-10: E11.9)
Allergies: Penicillin
Current Medications: Metformin 500mg, twice daily; Lisinopril 10mg, once daily
Surgical History: Appendectomy (2005)
Family History: Father - Type 2 Diabetes, Mother - Hypertension, Sister - No known conditions
Recent Medical Need:

Date of Visit: 09/14/2023
Visiting Specialist: Dr. Jane Wilson, Endocrinologist
Reason for Visit: Poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
Rationale for CGMS Recommendation:

Mr. Doe's recent HbA1c level was 9.3%, and his Fasting Blood Glucose was 190 mg/dL. He has been compliant with medications and follows a recommended diabetic-friendly diet. Despite these efforts, he has struggled with glycemic control. Furthermore, there have been frequent episodes of unrecognized hypoglycemia. Dr. Jane Wilson recommended the initiation of a CGMS device to monitor these fluctuations more accurately and adjust the treatment plan in real-time.

Requested Prior Authorization:

Device/Service: Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS)
Brand/Model: GlucoTrack Model XYZ
Duration: Long-term use
Considering the above, I strongly believe that the Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS) is a medical necessity for Mr. Doe. Regular fingerstick monitoring is not capturing the full scope of his glucose irregularities, and the CGMS will offer continuous insight into his glucose levels, leading to more informed treatment decisions.

I kindly request the prompt approval of this device to help Mr. Doe achieve optimal diabetes management, reduce the risk of severe hypoglycemia, and potentially decrease the likelihood of long-term diabetic complications.

Should you need any further information, records, or discussions about this request, please feel free to contact me directly at the phone number or email provided above.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Your cooperation in this will make a significant difference in the quality of life and health outcomes for Mr. John Doe.

Sincerely,

Dr. Spencer Maxted
General Practitioner
